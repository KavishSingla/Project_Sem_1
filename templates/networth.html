    <h1><b>How To Build Wealth: 7 Easy Steps To Get Started at Any Age</b></h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;">Written by BudgetBee</p>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Did you know that as of 2019 the average net worth by age 65 in America was roughly $1,216,000? Did that <br>number just make you gasp?</p> 
    <p>If so, you may be relieved to hear that knowing how to build wealth requires a relatively simple strategy: earning <br> money, saving money, and investing money. In fact, history shows that you can completely change your financial <br>future at any age.</p>
    <p>So what is wealth, exactly? Wealth is the sum of all financial assets minus the sum of all your debts (also known as <br> net worth). Ideally, this number remains positive at the end of the equation, but it can be negative, and that’s <br>
        still okay.</p>
        <p>While many often wonder how to become rich quickly, building wealth is a long game. It’s about leveraging <br> available tools (and exploring some lesser-known strategies) so that you can make the most of your income — no <br> matter if you’ve just started your first job or if you’re making a six-figure salary.</p>
        <p>Here, let’s explore seven simple wealth building strategies so that you can get started today.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image"><h1 style="text-align: left;">1. Adjust Your Mindset</h1>
    <img src="./static/1mindset.jpg" alt="image" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;"></div> <br>
    <div class="paragraph"><p>The first step to building wealth is to create a mindset that enables you to actually achieve your financial goals. In <br>studying the poverty gap in the American economy, psychologists point to something known as the bandwidth <br> tax, which describes poor decision-making that happens when you’re constantly surrounded by a sense of scarcity <br>or lack of resources. </p>
    <p>In other words, the stress of living paycheck-to-paycheck may cause your brain to get in its own way, preventing <br> you from making choices that could actually improve your financial position, like saving and investing. Instead, you <br>may look to emotional spending habits and waste your resources on things you don’t actually need.</p>
    <p>Overcoming a counterproductive mindset is one of the first hurdles in how to build wealth. The process includes:</p>
    <div class="list"><ul type="list">
    <li><p>Visualizing your personal goals. Do you hope to retire early (before age 65)? Buy a second home? Live in a <br> city? These will all impact your financial decisions.</p></li>
<p><li>Understanding your personal definition of wealth. A 2022 study found that Americans actually correlate <br>wealth with a state of mind. 42 percent of respondents associated wealth with having freedom, followed by <br> flexibility (23 percent), opportunity (18 percent), achievement (10 percent), and generosity (seven percent).</li></p></ul>
</div></div>
<div class="image"><h1 style="text-align: left;">2. Build a Budget</h1>
<img src="./static/2budget.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;"></div>
<div class="paragraph"> <br>
<p>Essential to any wealth building strategy is establishing a budget. According to a 2021 report from the Federal <br>Reserve, roughly 4 in 10 Americans do not have enough savings to pay out-of-pocket for a $400 <br>emergency expense.</p>
<p>To ensure that you’re not one of them, you’ll need a plan to start saving, and naturally, you need to make money in <br>order to start saving.</p>
<h3>Establish Sources of Income</h3>
<p>To start building your budget, first establish your net household income from all revenue sources each month. Tally <br>up your net income, which should include your post-tax take-home pay from your full-time job, a side-gig or <br>second job, and any other monthly income from additional sources like dividends or owning rental property.</p>
<h3>Run Your Household Like a Small Business</h3>
<p>Think of your household like you’re running a small business: Create an operating budget that outlines your <br>streams of revenue against your expenses. Map out both fixed recurring expenses (utilities, insurance payments, <br>childcare, etc.) and variable expenses (groceries, dining, entertainment, etc.)</p>
<p>A popular budgeting model is known as the 50/30/20 rule. In this rule, you divide your post-tax income into three <br> categories: essentials (50 percent), wants (30 percent), and savings (20 percent). These will help you understand <br>
     how much you should be spending and how much you need to save.</p>
<h3>Create a Contingency Fund</h3>
<p>Like any well-forecasted business, create a contingency fund to cover any unforeseen or emergency expenses. <br> How much money should you have saved in an account? Setting aside $1,000 is a good place to start, but <br>ultimately how much you should have in emergency savings depends on your individual lifestyle.</p>
<p>Other models recommend having three to six months worth of expenses saved away for emergency purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="image">
    <h1 style="text-align: left;">3. Pay Down Your Debt</h1>
    <img src="./static/3paydebt.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;">
</div> <br>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>The next step to building wealth is working to eliminate your debt. This includes curbing spending habits,  <br>paying more than the minimum balance on the credit you owe, and considering debt consolidation.</p>
    <h3>Curb Your Spending Habits</h3>
    <p>Despite inflation rising faster than wage gains, Americans showed no signs of slowing their spending as of 2022.  <br>But, if you’re looking to know how to build wealth, you’ll want to break the trend.</p>
    <p>First, gauge whether you’re an emotional spender. Do you use shopping as a distraction when you’re feeling <br>anxious? Do you buy new things to boost your mood when you’re sad? If you want to build wealth, you may be <br> spending far more than you should be each month, and that can have a big impact on your bottom line.</p>
    <p>Tips on how to stop spending include finding little reductions in a lot of places. Consider cutting back on a few of <br> those subscription or streaming services, dining out less, and unsubscribing from retail emails that offer <br>
        daily temptations.</p>
    <p>By cutting back a little bit in a lot of places, you could begin to see an improvement as early as your next monthly <br>bank statement.</p>
    <h3>Pay More Than the Minimum Balance</h3>
    <p>The minimum balance on your credit card bill is the lowest amount of repayment that lenders will accept without <br>applying a penalty or fee. If you’re only paying the minimum payment each month, your balance could end up <br> costing you far more over time. Due to your accrued interest, you may end up spending hundreds — or even <br>thousands — more than your actual balance.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of paying more than the minimum balance is that it improves credit utilization ratio, a ranking <br>factor in determining your credit score.</p>
    <p>Prioritizing paying debt with high interest rates first can also help save you money in the long run, as you’ll pay less <br> interest over time</p>
    <h3>Consider Debt Consolidation</h3>
    <p>Debt consolidation may be a great option for those who want to streamline their repayment strategy. It’s the  <br>process of merging all of the debt that you owe into a single bill so you can pay it each month with a fixed <br> interest rate.</p>
    <p>The benefits of debt consolidation include making a single payment (as opposed to keeping track of multiple <br>bills), potentially securing a lower interest rate, and avoiding damage to your credit score.</p>
    <p>The downfall for some is that you may be in debt for a longer period of time. You also face the possibility that you <br> wind up spending more on interest than your actual expenses in the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="image"><h1 style="text-align: left;">4. Invest in Your Retirement</h1>
<img src="./static/4invest.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;">
</div> <br>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>It can be tempting in your 20s and 30s to ignore your retirement savings in favor of freeing up funds for more <br> pressing, immediate needs. In doing so, you may be missing out in the long run. Begin a retirement plan by first <br> assessing your net worth.</p>
    <p>Setting up a retirement plan means setting aside money in financial accounts and letting it grow in the <br> background over time. The more time you give your money to grow, the more money you are likely to have in the <br>end. If you start investing in your 20s, you give that money a longer runway to compound over time.</p>
    <p>Two of the most popular types of retirement plans are a 401(k) and an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).</p>
    <h3>401(k)</h3>
    <p>A 401(k) is a retirement plan that allows you to choose between being compensated in cash or allocating a fraction <br> of its value to an account under the plan. As a type of defined-contribution plan, both your contributions and the <br>performance of the plan investments factor into your resulting balance.</p>
    <p>401(k) plans come with contribution limits, which is the maximum value you are allowed to contribute to your <br> account. Contribution limits tend to vary by age and plan type.</p>
    <h3>Individual Retirement Account (IRA)</h3>
    <p>An IRA is a retirement account that can provide tax advantages. There are two types of IRAs: a traditional IRA or a <br>Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow you to deduct a portion of your contributions from your taxable income each year.</p>
    <p>Roth IRAs are built with income you already paid taxes on. If you choose to withdraw money from your IRA, it’s <br>considered taxable income for traditional IRAs, but is tax-free for Roth IRAs.</p>
</div>
<div class="image">
  <h1 style="text-align: left;">5. Leverage Life Insurance Policies</h1>
  <img src="./static/5.life.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;">
</div> <br>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>At its core, a life insurance policy is intended as a safety net to help spouses, dependants and other loved ones <br> pay for critical expenses — such as mortgage payments, educational expenses, and more — after your passing. In <br> addition to its primary function, a lesser known benefit of a life insurance policy is that it can be used to help build <br> wealth over time.</p>
    <p>There are five key types of life insurance policies, but not all of them help build wealth. In addition to the policy’s <br>death  benefit, permanent life insurance policies offer the ability to earn cash value. Some even offer the ability to <br> borrow against the cash value during your lifetime.</p>
    <p>Let’s review types of life insurance policies and their fundamental differences to understand using life insurance to <br>build wealth.</p>
    <h3>Term Life Insurance</h3>
    <p>Term life insurance policies are less expensive and only provide coverage for a predetermined number of years. <br> After that, you have the option to renew your policy, but typically on an annual basis and at an adjusted rate. Term <br>life insurance policies do not offer cash value.</p>
    <h3>Whole Life Insurance (Permanent)</h3>
    <p>A whole life insurance policy is a type of permanent life insurance that offers coverage for the entire span of a <br> person’s life. It differs from term life insurance policies in that you do not need to renew it. In addition, whole life <br>insurance policies are intended to build tax-deferred cash value. As the policy’s cash value accrues, you have the <br>option of borrowing against it during your lifetime.</p>
    <h3>Universal Life Insurance (Permanent)</h3>
    <p>Universal life insurance is another type of permanent life insurance, but without a fixed interest rate for its cash <br>value, ultimately causing your cash value to fluctuate over time, all depending on what’s happening in the <br>
        larger market.</p>
    <h3>Variable Life Insurance (Permanent)</h3>
    <p>Similar to universal life insurance, the cash value of your policy changes based on how well your selected <br> investments perform. It differs from whole life insurance in that its cash value can be part of the policy’s <br>
        death benefit.</p>
        <h3>Final Expense Life Insurance (Permanent)</h3>
        <p>This type of life insurance is just as it sounds: It’s intended to cover expenses after your passing, such as remaining <br> debt, medical bills, and burial costs. It typically comes with fewer medical requirements, and its cash value options <br>are similar to that of a whole life policy.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note that using life insurance as an investment tool does not replace traditional retirement funds <br>like a 401(k).</p>
</div>
<div class="image"><h1 style="text-align: left;">6. Consider a Side-Gig</h1>
    <img src="./static/6considergig.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;">
</div> <br>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>If you really want to send your wealth-building strategy into overdrive, consider a supplementary form of income,<br> like a second job or side-gig. Another option for generating additional revenue is to create passive income like <br> owning rental property, taking on freelance work, or driving affiliate marketing revenue through a published blog.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the more money you make, the more you can save and invest.</p>
</div>
<div class="image">
    <h1 style="text-align: left;">7. Don’t Be Afraid to Start Small</h1>
    <img src="./static/7startsmall.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;">
</div> <br>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>You may wonder, “How can I build wealth with low income?” Rest assured that it’s possible to build wealth at any <br>income level, you just have to choose to start.</p>
    <p>Building wealth with small levels of income is about understanding your personal definition of wealth, applying <br>the same principles outlined here within the means of your income scale.</p>
    <h3>What is the Fastest Way to Start Building Wealth?</h3>
    <p>While you may be tempted to follow a “how to get rich quick” scheme, a natural way to start building wealth is <br> simply to accelerate your ability to save and invest — like dramatically reining in your expenses and doubling <br>down on repaying debt.</p>
    <p>The sooner you start, the sooner you can start building wealth.</p>
    <h3>How Long Does It Take to Start Building Wealth?</h3>
    <p>There’s no clear-cut length of time that you should expect to start seeing results, but some studies indicate that it <br>  may take about seven years for a wealth building strategy to start producing daily growth.</p>
    <p>Building wealth is about first understanding your personal definition of success, and then creating a strategy to <br> achieve your vision. It’s more about long-term planning and much less about quick wins, but with a clear <br> assessment of your income, a plan for shoring up your expenses, and wisely investing what remains, you’ll be on <br>your way to building wealth for generations to come.</p>
