    <h2>Why Is Investing Important?</h2>
    <p>As you get older, things tend to get more expensive. Gas prices increase, rent goes up, and even grocery <br>shopping is more pricey. This is because of inflation, but one way you may be able to combat inflation is <br>by investing.</p>
        <p>Investing can be a way to grow your wealth and outpace inflation. You’ve probably heard someone say “My <br>investments are going down”, or on the opposite side, “My investments are skyrocketing!” and thought to yourself: <br>“Should I be investing, too?”</p>
        <p>In many cases, investing can provide significant benefits, regardless of your age or current financial position. <br> Money management for young people can be difficult, but investing can be a good way to take control of your <br> financial future and feel more secure.</p>
        <p>Investing is important for many reasons, such as:</p>
        <img src="./static/investing_1.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;"> <br>
        <ul type="disc">
            <p><li>Potentially build wealth: A great option to consider for building your wealth is investing. Investing your money <br> can give you the opportunity to make more money in return. There are various ways you can consider <br> investing. You can invest in the stock market, real estate, or retirement accounts.</li></p>
            <p><li>Create passive income: We know that traditionally, in order to make money, you have to work. But what if <br> there was another way? There is, and it’s called investing. Investments have the potential to create passive <br>income, which is essentially money that is earned from doing little to no active work. Some examples of <br>investments that could generate passive income include rental properties and dividend stocks.</li></p>
            <p><li>Plan for retirement: Many people invest as a way to plan for retirement. Options include investing your money <br>into a 401(k) account or another retirement plan that is likely to increase in value over time. If you invest prior <br> to retirement, just imagine how much more money you’ll have saved up when you actually do retire.</li></p>
            <p><li>Save on taxes: If you invest the right way, you can also potentially save on taxes. There are various accounts <br>that offer tax advantages, like an IRA and 401(k). The earnings within these accounts are tax-deferred and are <br> usually deductible from your income, which means you could make more money while spending less on taxes <br> in the short-term.</li></p>
            <p><li>Combat inflation: Inflation erodes the value of cash and, as a result, raises the prices of goods. Inflation is <br>inevitable, but one way you can potentially fight inflation is by investing. One of the best ways to combat <br> inflation and prepare yourself for the uncertainties of finances is to invest in yourself. Investing in yourself is a <br> way to potentially increase your wealth and save money, despite the inflation that’s occurring beyond your <br>control.</li></p>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Kind of Investing Is Right for You?</h2>
        <p>There are many different kinds of investments, so it’s important to choose the type that works for you. When it <br>comes to investments for beginners, you’ll need to know what your risk tolerance is. Some investments are low risk <br>and some are high risk.</p>
        <img src="./static/investing_2.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 920px;">
        <p>Low risk investments are typically a much safer option and they’re a good place to start for beginners. High risk <br>investments present an opportunity to make more money, but carry a high potential for loss. It’s important to <br> figure out an investment strategy that you’re comfortable with.</p>
        <h2>Important Factors to Consider</h2>
        <p>Before you make any decisions about investing, there are a few important factors that you should keep in mind, <br>such as:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><p>Your investment strategy: It’s typically best not to go blind into investing. It can be helpful to have some sort of <br>financial plan that puts into perspective your investment goals and how you’re going to achieve them.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your timeframe and risk tolerance: Another important factor to think about when investing is what your <br>timeline looks like and what your risk tolerance is. If your goal is to make a lot of money in the short-term, your <br>investment strategy may look different when compared to someone whose aim is to earn small but steady <br> returns in the long run.</p></li>
            <li><p>Where you want to invest your money: There are many different places where you can invest your money <br>based on your investment goals, but it’s also important to consider diversifying your investment portfolio. By <br> diversifying your investments, you have the power to more confidently reduce your risk and maximize <br>your returns.</p></li>
            <li><p>How to invest your money: There are two different ways you can approach investing: active investing vs. <br>passive investing. Active investing is a more hands-on approach, while passive investing generally requires <br>less effort. You can make money with both ways, so it’s just a matter of figuring out which one you prefer.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Much Should You Be Investing?</h2>
        <p>The amount of money you should be investing is ultimately a personal preference, but it typically depends on how <br>much money you’re making. Some people recommend putting 10% to 20% of your after-tax income towards <br>investments, but that can differ depending on your particular circumstances.</p>
        <h2>Where to Make Investments Based on Age</h2>
    <p>Someone who’s 25 is probably making very different investment choices than someone who’s 50. In general, age <br> can play a sizable role in the type of investments you make and where you choose to invest your money.</p>
    <p>Ages 25-40 is when a lot of people seriously start saving for retirement and looking into investments. At this age,<br> you might focus mostly on the potential growth of stocks in your retirement savings. A Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) <br>may both be good places to start saving for retirement.</p>
    <p>When you’re between 41-56 years old, you might start to take advantage of your contribution limits for your <br> retirement accounts and contribute more money. This is also the time when you may want to consider saving in a <br> taxable account. As you get older, it could also be a good idea to add an allocation to bonds.</p>
    <p>When you’re between 57-65 years old, that’s when your retirement savings really start to take effect. At this point, it <br> could be a good idea to broaden your tax diversification with multiple types of accounts and allocate more <br> towards bonds and cash.</p>
    <h2>Best Investments for Those Just Getting Started</h2>
    <p>It’s never too late to start investing. As of 2020 approximately 55% of U.S. adults invest in the stock market as a way <br>to make more money and save for retirement. So if you’re just getting started in investing, consider sticking with <br>the following types of investments:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><p>High-yield savings account: This is a very simple and straightforward way to invest and an account can even <br> be opened through an online bank. A high-yield savings account may be a good short-term investment to <br> consider if you are looking to produce returns quickly.</p></li>
        <li><p>401(k) or another retirement plan: If you want to invest as a way to save for retirement, you might consider <br> opening up a 401(k). Many employers also offer to match your 401(k) contributions, which means that your <br>employer will make contributions to your 401(k) plan depending on how much you contribute.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mutual funds: Mutual funds may be a smart place to start investing because they’re generally easy to access <br> and give you the opportunity to invest in a basket of stocks or bonds. Mutual funds hold multiple company <br>stocks within one investment, so it can also be a good way to diversify your investment portfolio.</p></li>
        <li><p>Certificates of Deposits: Certificates of Deposits, or CDs, can also be good for investment beginners because <br>they offer a fixed interest rate with typically higher, predictable returns and more security.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bottom Line: Start Investing Now Rather Than Later</h2>
    <p>Learning how to invest can be tricky, but fortunately you can use investment apps for beginners to help you get <br>started. It’s also important to have a basic understanding of the history of money so that you can feel more <br> prepared throughout your investing journey.</p>
    <p>And now that we’ve covered the basics of investments, you should have a better grasp of what investing is and the <br> many ways it can benefit you. But before you can start investing, you’ll need a solid understanding of basic <br>investment terminology, which we’ll be discussing in the next chapter of our investing series.</p>
